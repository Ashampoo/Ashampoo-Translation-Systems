        <source>Ashampoo PDF Pro 3 creates, edits, merges and converts PDFs. Creating and editing is as simple as
            working with a Word document, with custom comments, layouts and images. Ashampoo PDF Pro 3 supports multiple
            popular formats (Microsoft Word, RTF, HTML, EPUB, JPEG etc.) for easy document exchange, e.g. with Microsoft
            Excel. Document images and colors are fully replaceable and customizable and the built-in find and replace
            feature supports both text and fonts. Merging multiple documents is a simple drag &amp; drop operation and
            the ability to create portfolios or photo albums greatly facilitate working with multiple files. The
            integrated text recognition (OCR) instantly converts scanned text into computer-editable text. Word
            processing is highly versatile with support for wrapping text around objects, powerful spell checking and
            auto-hyphenation. Inserting, moving, cropping, masking and deleting individual images is also possible.
            Sensitive information can be blacked out and documents protected with AES encryption. With the included
            printer driver, PDFs can be created from virtually any Windows application. Version 3 comes with a nifty
            ribbon-based interface with an eye-friendly dark mode as well as a customizable quick access bar and
            space-efficient fold-out elements. For long-term digital preservation, we've added PDF/A export, while
            digital signatures help users add an extra layer of security to their important documents. Furthermore, the
            status bar now features seamless zooming and work modes are switchable at the click of a button. In
            addition, comparing documents is now faster and more precise than ever before thanks to a new compare
            algorithm.

        <source>By default, Windows 11 will only run on PCs that meet the minimum requirements. First, Windows 11 Check
            &amp; Enable quickly analyzes your hardware and reports possible compatibility issues. The program then goes
            deeper to find out if Windows 11 will still run on your machine regardless. In the event of an incompatible
            CPU or missing TPM 2.0 support, Windows 11 Check &amp; Enable can still enable the installation since the
            more prevalent TPM 1.20 will also suffice. Windows 11 Check &amp; Enable adds two Registry entries to your
            system to enable the installation of Windows 11 on officially unsupported systems. Note that, if you install
            Windows 11 on an officially unsupported system, Microsoft will no longer support your PC and it won't be
            entitled to receive updates. The verification process in Windows 11 Check &amp; Enable includes TPM (trusted
            platform module) as well as all installed or connected components, and relevant configurations. The
            following hardware components and configurations are inspected: CPU, RAM, hard disk, display resolution,
            graphics card, DirectX, WDDM, TPM, UEFI, SecureBoot. If your PC fails in any of these categories, you'll be
            notified along with possible fixes. Even though the installation of Windows 11 backed by Windows 11 Check
            &amp; Enable is legally safe, we recommend (as with any major upgrade!) that you back up your machine with
            Ashampoo® Backup Pro 16 prior to the OS upgrade. This will take care of the risks generally involved with
            any major system upgrade.

        <source>Ashampoo® Windows 11 Check &amp; Enable checks your PC for Windows 11 compatibility. Even if your PC

        <source>Although Windows 11 will run on systems without TPM 2.0 or compatible CPUs, the other requirements are
            more rigorously enforced. Make sure to run Windows 11 Check &amp; Enable to be on the safe side and find out

        <source>Can I now install Windows 11 on any PC?</source>

    </translation>

    <translation id="textids.content.T_1904_TEXT_4">
        <target></target>
        <source>Absolutely. Microsoft have themselves pointed out that Windows 11 is installable on systems that fail to
            meet all of their system requirements. Installation on numerous test PCs went flawlessly. Yet, for liability
            reasons, Microsoft still cite theoretical risks and the possibility that future updates may be unavailable.
            We therefore recommend (as with any major upgrade!) that you back up your machine with Ashampoo® Backup Pro
            16 prior to the OS upgrade. A complete system backup ensures you can try out the new OS risk-free.

        <source>Even if your PC is deemed incompatible, there's a loophole: Windows 11 Check &amp; Enable can allow your
            PC to install Windows 11 in the event of an incompatible CPU or missing TPM 2.0 support! In this case, the
            far more prevalent TPM 1.20 is all you need. Windows 11 Check &amp; Enable can add two Registry entries to
            your system to allow installation of Windows 11 anyway. Note that, if you install Windows 11 on an
            officially unsupported system, Microsoft will no longer support your PC and it won't be entitled to receive
            updates.

        <target></target>
        <source>Windows stores common application settings and configuration data in a central database called Windows
            Registry. Over time, this database can become cluttered with leftover data from no longer installed software
            and entries can even become corrupted. Since so many applications rely on the Registry for information,
            clutter and data corruption can cause noticeable performance drops and make your PC feel sluggish and
            unresponsive. Frequent error messages or problems when uninstalling programs can also be caused by Windows
            Registry issues.
